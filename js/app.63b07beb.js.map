They help shore up bones, heal wounds, and bolster your immune system. They also convert food into energy, and repair cellular damage. Your body needs only tiny amounts of them, yet failing to get even those small quantities virtually guarantees disease.

Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Timothy 3:16-17 says: All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Simply put, the word of God should be active in our lives to work on our hearts, attitudes and thoughts, and to equip, teach, rebuke, correct and train us.</p>\n                <p\n                  class=\"text-white\"\n                >Every day on this site, as a way to encourage others to spend time with God, we post what we call “Spiritual Vitamins”.

All are encouraged to read the scripture/chapter from the Bible themselves and journal what rhema God gives them.

These are my notes from today’s Spiritual Vitamins: The command I received from this is: \" +\r\n          this.notepad.command +\r\n          \". The way I would apply this is: \" +\r\n          this.notepad.application +\r\n          \". My rhema which means an utterance or thing said in Greek is: \" +\r\n          this.notepad.rhema +\r\n          \". And finally the promise I got from today's reading is: \" +\r\n          this.notepad.promise +\r\n          \".
